    <h1>Arc Reactor</h1>
    <p>The Arc Reactor was a device initially designed by Howard Stark, and later adapted by his son, Tony. A massive arc reactor provided power for the sprawling complex of Stark Industries until its destruction,[1] and later the Stark Tower.[2] This design was miniaturized by Tony to power a life-saving electromagnet in his chest, which had an energy output of 8 gigajoules per second</p>
  
    <h1>Mark XLVII</h1>
    <p>The Mark XLVII armor is from Spider-Man: Homecoming is directly inspired by the Ultimate Marvel comics, with its middle portion sporting a silver color. The design, however, is the same from the Mark XLVI, although its main improvement is the ability to be controlled by Wi-Fi without the need for a headset.</p>
    
    <h1>Mark XLVI</h1>
    <p>The miniature arc reactors scattered throughout the armor enhance its power and its collapsible structure enable Tony to manipulate it more easily. He can put it on effortlessly with the touch of a button and the helmet can retract into the suit. Tony keeps a glove stored in his watch that has sonar and flashbang blasts that help him fight Bucky even without the rest of his suit.</p>
    
    <h1>Mark LXXXV</h1>
    <p>Tony's final armor blends the Mark L's sleekness and nanotechnology with a visibly more muscular and stronger design. Not only does this model perfect all of the previous features â€” it also manages to be mighty enough to withstand an all-out fight with Thanos and harness the power of all six Infinity Stones.</p>
